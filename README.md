**This organizer app is only the fron-end part of the whole project. If You would like to develop the back-end feel free to do it!**

Creating a user doesnt work atm, just log-in using these: login: user1 password: user1pass.

Everything is created with vanilla JS, except the table, which is coded in html.

Feel free to upgrade this project!
